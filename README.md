Hi there. I used to make [big, immersive installations](https://endquote.com), now I work in Design Technology at [PlayStation](https://www.playstation.com/).

I'm currently focused on improving our design and prototyping process by moving the whole workflow to React and React Native. It's pretty interesting stuff, and [I'd love some help](https://boards.greenhouse.io/sonyinteractiveentertainmentplaystation/jobs/2278053).
